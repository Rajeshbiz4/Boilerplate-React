<br />
<p>Company may use third-parties to facilitate or provide the Service on Company's behalf, process payments, provide customer support, perform Service related services or assist in analyzing how the Service is used. Such third-parties have access to your personal information only to perform these specific tasks and are contractually bound to not disclose or use it for any other purpose. Company will disclose your personal data to the extent that this is legally required or necessary for the establishment, exercise or defense of legal claims and legal process, in the event of an emergency pertaining to your health or safety or if you violate Company's Terms and Conditions of Service or Privacy Policy.</p>
<br />
<p>Pursuant to Section 1798.83 of the California Civil Code, residents of California may obtain certain information about the types of personal information that companies with whom they have an established business relationship have shared with third-parties during the proceeding calendar year.

<p>In general, third-party providers used by Company will only collect, use and disclose your information to the extent necessary to allow them to perform the services they provide to you.</p>
<br />
<p>However, third-party providers such as payment processors may have their own privacy policies in respect to the information you are required to provide to them. Company recommends that you read any such third-party privacy policies so you can understand the manner in which your personal information will be handled by those providers.</p>
<br />
<p>In particular, please note that certain third-party providers may be located in a different jurisdiction than either you or Company. In the event you proceed with a transaction that involves a third-party provider, your information may become subject to the laws of the jurisdiction in which that third-party provider or its facilities are located.</p>
